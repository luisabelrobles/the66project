    <div class="container-fluid problem-sec">

                <div class="col-sm">
                    <h1>So what is the problem exactly?</h1>
                    <h2>The conversation we are not having.</h2>
                    <p>In our communities of color, we are not having important conversations on mental health with our family members and friends. There is a negative stigma with seeking professional help and when we are looking for help, where do we go? Are there therapists of color that can relate to us? The bigger issue is that we may not even be aware that we are suffering from a mental illness.</p>
                    <p><a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/" target="_blank">Out of 9.8 millions of adults with a serious mental illness, 25% were living below the poverty line.</a> Those are just adults, think about the children who are excluded from that statistic. Lastly, add the adults who are not aware that they are suffering from a mental illness.</p>
                    <p>In our communities, traumas are passed from generation to generation because we lack self-awareness. We are not given the resources or opportunities to become self-aware. Without awareness, our community, families,and children will suffer from our own traumas that are left undealt with.</p>
                    <h2>Our health has only been getting worse.</h2>
                    <p><a href="https://minorityhealth.hhs.gov/omh/browse.aspx?lvl=4&lvlid=70" target="_blank">Among Mexican American women, 77% are overweight or obese.</a> Hispanic Americans are 1.2x more likely to become obese or overweight. <a href="https://minorityhealth.hhs.gov/omh/browse.aspx?lvl=4&lvlid=25">About 4 out of 5 African American women are overweight or obese.</a> African Americans are 1.4x more likely to become obese or overweight. Our families are a victim of a growing epidemic.</p>
                    <p>Our neighborhoods are called <a href="https://foodispower.org/access-health/food-deserts/" target="_blank">"food deserts" </a>because we do not have access to nutritional foods. The problem goes beyond access to clean foods. Our communities are not being educated or conditioned to eat nutritious foods.</p>

    <!----------------------****** THE SOLUTION ******----------------------------->
    <div class="container-fluid solution-sec">

                    <h1>Every problem has a solution, here is our's.</h1>
                    <h2>Bridging the gap between physical and mental health.</h2>
                    <p>Our physical and mental health depend on our habits. A healthy body influences a healthy mind and a healthy mind influences a healthy body. Exercising and nutritious eating builds a healthy brain and body. This helps us become more atuned to ourselves, connecting our mind with our body. This causes us to become self-aware, helping us recognize our emotions and any underlying illnesses that are holding us back from achieving our goals.</p>
                    <p>Our everyday habits determine our present and future. We are creating the systems to make establishing daily habits as easy as possible. Our core daily habits include exercise, eating nutritious foods, and meditation.</p>
                    <h2>Ongoing education for lifelong personal growth & awareness.</h2>
                    <p>A healthy mind and body is not an end-point, it is a process. Personal growth and awareness is something we must do for the rest of or lives. If it is making us better, why wouldn't we do it for the rest of our life?</p>
                    <p>The leaders and coaches of The 66 Project have committed themselves to lifelong growth in fitness, nutrition, and self-development. The health industry is full of information that it can be overwhelming. As we continue to learn in our fields, so will you. We will be sharing with the community our learnings and lessons so that we can all grow together.</p>
                    <h2>For the community, led by the community.</h2>
                    <p>We take "leading by example," very seriously. Instead of telling you what to do, you will be following our own exercise & nutrition plans along with our self-awareness methods. Everyone involved in The 66 Project will be following the same structure. Everyone is not the same, but our focus is to help you establish daily habits in exercise, nutrition, and mind. By building a strong foundation in healthy habits, you are capable of lifelong growth.</p>
                    <p>We understand the difficultes of living a healthy life and getting started. Our method creates a unique experience while building a strong community. You are not alone in this lifelong journey, you will be having the support of everyone in The 66 Project community. Our journey togther of healthy living will help us move forward together. It is a community effort, surrounding ourselves with each other for lifelong positivity, growth, and inspiration.</p>
